        <h2>What we collect</h2>

        <h3>Your email</h3>

        <p>Nomaste collects your email address in order to create an account. The reason we require you to create an account is so that your data can be protected by authenticated access, and easily retrieved by you and your group members on multiple devices.</p>

        <h3>The content you create</h3>

        <p>When you create recipes, meal plans, and tags, that information is stored in a database so it can be persisted, queried and retrieved for your convenience.</p>

        <p>This information is private by default. If you choose to share a dinner recipe, the accompanying text and images can be viewed and copied by your followers.</p>

          <li>Nomaste does not ask for or store any data that is not needed.</li>
