I'd like to share some things I've learned after over 16 years in software development. These are revelations I've had either during late-night debugging sessions, working on open source projects, and just regular day-to-day software development. 

## 1. Every unexplainable thing that happens has cause. 

When you are new at software development, certain strange behaviors from your application at first appear totally random, at times it seems like they could only be explained by the metaphysical. But through trial and error, and deep dives, you learn there's always a rational cause. And you rediscover this over and over again. That was a huge revelation for me.

I remember one night debugging an interactive project at work. I was working against a deadline, and there was some UI bug I could not solve, and I remember thinking to myself, "this is voodoo". It was absolutely unexplainable. Everything I could see should have made my code work, I was 1000% sure. I refreshed the page over and over. I sat back in exasperation. Then tried again. Finally after some time I found an almost imperceptable typo, that fixed the problem.

Probably every software developer has had experiences like this. It feels just like a lot of things in life that you can't explain and no one will ever explain. And the more bugs you fix, whether they are simple or a complex chain of events that create a unique state in which things break, the more you realize software is like a microcosm of the world.

## 1. Allowing more people to contribute to a project makes it better in ways you could have never guessed.

## 1. Software developers never speak in absolutes.
