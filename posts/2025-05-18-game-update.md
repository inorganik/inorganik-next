Last time I gave a game update, over a year ago, I said the game was nearly done, which was true! Until I decided to redo it.

The game involves making blocks, and originally, you would farm them. As you can imagine, that was like watching grass grow. So I decided to introduce several interactive 3D factories, and have collaborated with a talented designer to create them. Here’s a sneak peak!

The **mix factory** makes block mix:

The **block factory** makes blocks from block mix:

All to the end of making collectibles, which come in various series that are all unique and fun! Here’s **Video Game Series 1**:

This is just part of the game. You’ll also manage inventory, plan truck routes between your factories, and transport goods to product hubs where your products will be sold in a **global, real-time market**!

You’ll save your cash to buy ever-bigger cities based on the real the world and climb the leaderboard to be Cities 4 Sale’s top player.
